/*Given two integer variables x and y, perform the following operations:

p: Addition of x and y
q: Subtraction of y from x
r: Multiplication of x and y
s: Floating-point division of x by y
t: Integer division of x by y
u: Modulo (remainder when x is divided by y)
Examples:

Input: x = 1, y = 2
Output: 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1
Explanation: The given operations are performed:
Addition of x and y = 3
Subtraction of y from x = -1
Multiplication of x and y = 2
Floating-point division of x by y = 0.500
Integer division of x by y = 0
Modulo of x and y = 1
Hence, the output is 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1.
Input: x = 3 ,y = 4 
Output: 7 -1 12 0.750 0 3
Explanation: The given operations are performed.
Constraints:

-100 ≤ x, y ≤ 100
